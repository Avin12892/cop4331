Vision Statement for Group 10

Group 10 is making an audio player with an incorporated visualiser that will function via machine learning.
This product will take in an audio file and play it. While it is playing it will produce a picture that it feels is "good" based on
past ratings viewers have given other pictures. Additionally, it will predict what genre the song is as it plays using similar 
machine learning concepts. 
Our product is important as it will produce identities for songs via the pictures it draws, providing a new way to think about music.
Additionally, its ability to learn genres will allow users to find similar music to what is being played if they were not
already familiar with the genre.
