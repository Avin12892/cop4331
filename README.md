## Installation/Requirements
This project uses Python 3. You'll probably need to have ffmpeg installed and accessible on your system. To setup your environment, please make a new virtualenv using `python -m venv venv` and then activate it by using `source venv/bin/activate`. Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that you may need to have numpy installed first, as one of the packages' dependencies requires it; you can do that by running `pip install numpy` first.
